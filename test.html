    <h1> Why is your logo a weird-looking fruit-thing? </h1>
    <p> It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimina_triloba">pawpaw</a>, 
        the largest edible fruit indigenous to North America. (Gourds are <em>vegetables</em>, people!) 
        It's native to where I grew up (Indiana), and a well-kept delicious secret even to locals. Imagine a cross 
        between banana custard and a mango--pawpaws are absolutely amazing!</p>
    <p> As a fellow Hoosier <em>also</em> aspiring to greatness, I have a strong affinity for the little tree, and on top of
        that, I'm a big pawpaw proselytizer--I've gotten my labmates hooked on the stuff! </p>
    
    <h1> What's up with you, Zach? </h1>
    <p> Well, my dad has really gotten me back into Jackson Browne's music recently. I feel like he has a surprisingly natural
        grasp of existentialist philosophy for someone who probably never studied it, ya know? </p>
    <p> I went to the University of Pennsylvania for undergrad, planning to study either quantum computing or linguistics, but my 
        interests took a sharp turn into psycholinguistics my senior year, and I graduated with a bachelor's in linguistics and a 
        minor in computer science. Right now, I'm finishing my PhD in Brain and Cognitive Science at the University of Rochester. </p>
    
    <h1> What research are you doing at the moment? </h1>
    <p> My interests are still as broad as ever, but I've been focusing on how people understand each other when 
        they sometimes talk so differently. This has manifested itself in a bunch of different projects. </p>
    <ul>
        <li><h3 style="display: inline">How does the need for clear communication shape our language?
            <br />(Computational modeling)</h3> &nbsp; Languages all change over time,
            as do the sounds that are used in those languages. Sometimes, two distinct sounds merge to form a single sound. For example,
            many parts of America now pronounce <em>caught</em> and <em>cot</em> the same. You might think which sounds merge would be
            completely random, but if the need to understand each other exerts some pressure on how sounds change, some changes are more
            likely than others. Theoretically, the way we <em>use</em> our languages could actually play a hand in how they evolve!
            <br />
            I'm developing computational models to estimate the impact of phonological mergers on how easy it is to understand each word in
            the English language. Unlike previous work, I'm doing this in a way that attempts to capture how the acoustic/perceptual similarities
            of different sounds interacts with the structure of the lexicon and how English is used. 
            <br /></li>
        
        <li><h3 style="display: inline">How do we get better at understanding accents?
            <br />(Pupillometry)</h3> &nbsp; Unfamiliarly accented speech can be hard to process initially,
            but we can rapidly improve our understanding by merely listening for a few minutes. Is this adaptation merely surface-level
            changes in comprehension and reaction times, or does our processing become more efficient at a deeper level? Pupil dilation
            is linked to certain kinds of processing difficulty--I'm interested in using pupillometry to explore how accent adaptation
            affects processing. 
            <br/></li>
        <li><h3 style="display: inline">How do we optimally handle information to learn an accent?
            <br />(Over-the-web behavioral experiments)<b> &nbsp; BALBLSDALDSALBDS</li>

    <h1> Why did you think a Q&A format was appropriate for an 'About Me' page? </h1>
    <p> Ya got me. My landing page was already descriptive enough for most introductions--I really just made this page
        to explain what the pawpaw logo was. </p>

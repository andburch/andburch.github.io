    <h1> Why is your logo a weird-looking fruit-thing? </h1>
    <p> It's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asimina_triloba">pawpaw</a>, 
        the largest edible fruit indigenous to North America. (Gourds are <em>vegetables</em>, people!). 
        It's native to where I grew up (Indiana), and a well-kept delicious secret even to locals. Imagine a cross 
        between banana custard and a mango--pawpaws are absolutely amazing!</p>
    <p> As a fellow Hoosier <em>also</em> aspiring to greatness, I have a strong affinity for the little fruit, and on top of
        that, I'm a big pawpaw proselytizer--I've got my labmates hooked on the stuff! </p>

    <h1> Why is your logo a weird-looking ant? </h1>
    <p> This baby is an illustration of "<i>Ectatomma metallicum</i>," a misnamed ant featured in 
        W.W. Froggatt's 1907 <i>Australian Insects</i>. (This is the same unfortunately named Walter Wilson Fraggat known for
        publishing other such popular works as <i>Sheep-maggot flies and their parasites</i> and
        <i>Insects living in figs, with some account of caprification</i>.)        
        Ah, anyway, the species is now properly known as <i>Rhytidoponera metallica</i> or by its logically consistent common names:
        the green-head ant / the <i><b>metallic pony ant</b></i>. Although I am <strike><del>not yet</del></strike> <b>only recently</b> 
        personally acquainted with <i>R. metallica</i>,
        I have always been a huge fan of its New World cousin, <i>Ectatomma ruidum</i>. But since ole Froggie passed away a while back and his
        illustrations are in now the public domain... I figured I and can snatch this one up for free, 
        and most people can't tell a difference anyway!

    <h1> Why is your logo a weird-looking ant? </h1>
    <p> This baby is an illustration of "<i>Ectatomma metallicum</i>," an misnamed ant featured in 
        W.W. Froggatt's 1907 <i>Australian Insects</i>. Described as a "delicate" child by his mother, the 19th century entomologist and occasional vine inspector
        Walter Wilson Froggatt (yes, that was an unfortunate name, even back then) led an exciting life, publishing such well-known
        works as <i>Sheep-maggot flies and their parasites</i> and <i>Insects living in figs, with some account of caprification</i>.
        Ah, anyway, the species is now properly known as <i>Rhytidoponera metallica</i> or by its logically consistent common names,
        the green-head ant or the <i><b>metallic pony ant</b></i>. Although I am not yet personally acquainted with <i>R. metallica</i>,
        I am a big fan of its New World cousin, <i>Ectatomma ruidum</i>. But since ole Froggie passed away a while back and his
        illustrations are in now the public domain... I figured I and can snatch it up for free, without crediting him!

    <h1> Why is my logo a weird-looking ant? </h1>
    <p> This baby is an illustration of "<i>Ectatomma metallicum</i>," a misnamed ant featured in 
        W.W. Froggatt's 1907 <i>Australian Insects</i>. (This is the same unfortunately named Walter Wilson Froggatt known for
        other such popular works as <i>Sheep-maggot flies and their parasites</i> and
        <i>Insects living in figs, with some account of caprification</i>.)        
        Ah, anyway, the species is now properly known as <i>Rhytidoponera metallica</i> or by its logically consistent common names:
        the green-head ant / the <i><b>metallic pony ant</b></i>. </p>
    <p> Although I have nothing against <i>R. metallica</i>, I'm much more into its amazing
        New World cousin, <i>Ectatomma ruidum</i>. But since they look so similarâ€”and since ole
        Froggie's illustrations are in now the public domain... No one has to know, okay? </p>
        
    <h1> What research am I doing at the moment? </h1>

        <li><h3 style="display: inline">What strategies and rules do ants use during collective transport?
            <br />(Vertical transport)</h3> &nbsp; Aside from humans, ants are the only organisms that regularly
            cooperate to transport items too difficult to be moved by an individual. (Think of moving that heavy sofa into
            your friend's new house.) Cooperative transport in ants is quite understudied, but even so,
            most of the current work focuses on transport over artificially flat surfaces. Ants must navigate over
            much more difficult terrain in the wild.<br />
            ALthough <a href="https://youtu.be/vNFL-6bsR-k?t=3m53s">this behavior has been knowm for years</a>, we know
            virtually nothing about how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mn_RLyUs8L0">
            ants manage to move massive objects up sheer vertical surfaces</a>! (Now think of moving that heavy sofa up 40 flights of
            stairs to your friend's new high-rise apartment.)  We don't even know if they use
            different techniques or strategies when climbing up walls or carrying over the ground.

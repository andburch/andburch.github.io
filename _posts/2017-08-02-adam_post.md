When a keyboard enthusiast pictures a keyboard case in their mind, it's often one of two things: a standard minimalistic covering or a sleek industrial design.  RAMA's M65-a, /u/evangs' MiniVan, the FJELL keyboard case---the gorgeous curves and edges of these keyboard revel in simplicity and modern machining.  

I love the look, but I sometimes feel that this aesthetic has a somewhat limited imagination. Just because the technology is modern doesn't mean the *keyboard* has to look modern.

In fact, I think technology has progressed to the point where we can start looking *back* for inspiration. 

## Introducing _ADAM_

<!--more-->

**ADAM** is a Neoclassical split ortholinear porcelain keyboard. Those words have probably never been arranged next to each other in the history of the universe, but here we are.

<p class = "figcaption">NOTE: all the images here are just renders of the left-hand halves, not photos. The pictured keycaps are <em>not</em> part of my design and have only been added in (poorly) to help depict what the end product might look like with caps.</p>

<p class = "figcaption">Another view from the side. From here on out, I'll stop the hokey photoshops and keep the stand-in keys and the keyboard body the same color. </p>

### The Inspiration

The name **ADAM** is doubly fitting: it is a reference to both the Biblical Adam, as the first of its kind, and the Adam brothers who created the style of architecture that inspired it ([known as "Adam style" or "Adamesque"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_style)).

![Gloss white with stand-in caps, viewed from the front.]({{ site.url }}/images/adam_ic/white_keys_front.png)

<p class = "figcaption">I'm currently working on two colors of glazes: Celadon green and gloss white. Early prototypes will be in Celadon green, as it highlights the features better than gloss white, and is easier to work with in terms of consistency/pooling.</p>

The fact that Adam style incorporates simplified Rococo and Baroque elements works perfectly with the natural constraints of the manufacturing process.  Not only would the intricate detail and complex geometries of *true* Rococo/Baroque be lost in the glazing process, but they could have easily pushed the keyboard over the edge from "ornate" to "gaudy."

The front of the keyboard features a cartouche surrounded by paneling. I actually drew the bolection profile to imitate a real profile used at the Palace of Versailles, but the detail is too fine to make out in the finished product.

<p class = "figcaption">This is what will actually be printed for the Let's Split PCB version. (The hand-wired version will probably have a further ledge below for mounting the chip/batteries/etc.) The plate will be mounted on the ledges (one of which you can see from this angle), leaving the underside open for access and LEDs. Ignore the cutoff text in the bottom left corner--these were rendered online, so all I have are screenshots.</p>

The sides of the keyboard are decorated with simplified [festoons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festoon). Festoons are very characteristic of the Adam style, and keep the sides interesting while not distracting (also, festoons are sometimes called *swag*, which is pretty funny). I might test how adding more detail to festoons looks, but the smoothness is growing on me.

<p class = "figcaption">A side view of what will actually be printed for the PCB version, demonstrating the festoons.</p>

The rear has two holes for the MicroUSB cable and TRRS jack, and sports the classic Greek urn---an object prevalent in the Adam brothers' work. The renders on this page are designed to accommodate /u/wootpatoot's [Let's Split v2 PCB](https://github.com/climbalima/let-s-Split-v2). 

![Celadon green with stand-in caps, viewed from the back.]({{ site.url }}/images/adam_ic/green_keys_back_close.png)

<p class = "figcaption">A view of the back design for the PCB version, with the festoons that I'm considering removing. Again, the keycaps are not going to be printed. Notice the slight asymmetry.</p>

Somewhat frustratingly, the USB and TRRS connections are not symmetrically aligned on the PCB, meaning that the holes in the back cannot be equally spaced. Hand-wired versions of this case will feature nicely symmetric holes for those interested in wiring it themselves.  I'm currently debating whether the festoons on the back are too distracting---feedback would be appreciated.

## Why Porcelain? 

To me, it doesn't make sense to make **ADAM** in anything *other* than porcelain. Other than architecture, pottery has always been my favorite form of art.  Most hobbyist plastic keyboard prints I've seen online turn out looking relatively ugly to me, requiring lots of sanding and painting to make them look professional. The 3D printing process for porcelain makes everything smooth and even, gives it a nice heft and feel, and the way some of the glaze pools and highlights the features of the keyboard looks stunning.

The obvious "drawback" of using ceramic is that if you drop it from a height onto a hard surface, it might crack. But I don't really consider this a drawback so much as something inherent to the sort of product I'm trying to make. 

**ADAM** is *not* designed to be a travel keyboard. 

It is meant to sit on your desk, similar to a piece of furniture.  Although it is relatively durable, if it breaks, you can do what people have been doing with broken pottery for thousands of years: **_repair it_**.

To me, cracks in a piece of pottery make it look more interesting---give it more *history*---which is what I had in mind when designing **ADAM**. I love the idea of embracing this aesthetic, maybe even drawing *attention* to the history of the object, such as using [kintsugi](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kintsugi) to highlight the cracks.  I'm honestly debating whether I want to *intentionally* shatter my first production and glue it back together with kintsugi[^1]---a porcelain keyboard with golden spiderweb cracks would look *amazing*.

## Customization / alternative versions







* old, heirloom, soul
* organic, wabisabi


After seeing [Adrien Friggeri's new 'Blanck' keyboard](http://medium.com/@friggeri/the-new-blanck-keyboard-c7563c4f9fa) a couple months ago, I was struck by two things:

 1. Wow, I didn't know it was possible to 3D print in porcelain, and
 2. If he had made a Let's Split case, he could have printed the entire thing in ceramic and ditched the (in my opinion) unsightly leather/wood connector.
 
Knowing nothing about 3D modeling, I set out to make a sleek, curved porcelain case---I initially wanted to make a ["squircle"/superellipsoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle) design, but there came a point where I stopped,

I like statistical models. I like webcomics. I like not having to suffer through deciding whether a webcomic is ever going to update regularly again. I began to ask myself, "Can I use statistical modelling to tell me when I should stop hoping a webcomic will keep updating?"

Nothing is more haunting than that oft-repeated phrase: "updates when?" It's not even about the wait, it's about the _uncertainty_---either end or start updating, don't keep me in limbo!  I would love it if I could make a model that could just _tell_ me, "Hey, this comic is entering its death spiral, abandon ship!"  Also, I just like learning new statistical methods.

Although that model is still in the works, I've gotten my hands on a bunch of cool data in the meantime.  This post isn't quite a tutorial; it's more like a demonstration of how you can fun with simple web scraping and niche interests---but I've attached all the code I used, complete with documentation and a flexible design for newbies who want to start collecting their own data.

<!--more-->

## Web scraping 101

In order to make a model, you generally need data to train it on.  Most webcomics don't have a downloadable R database of all their updates, so you'll have to get the data yourself.  You can click through potentially thousands of pages, recording the dates manually, or you can use **web scraping** to do it automatically.

If you use Python and want an incredibly easy-to-get-into web scraping tool, check out the Python module, [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (I used `bs4`). In a nutshell, it loads HTML pages and parses the elements into a tree automatically. Extracting, say, all the `img` tags on a page can be as simple as: `soup.find_all('img')`. Beautiful Soup is pretty simple to learn and the [documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) makes it a breeze. Check my source code at the end for the code I used.

## Broodhollow updates: a story of an author's life

"Broodhollow."  The name sounds like a title that a moody fifteen-year-old would come up with, but it is **absolutely** my favorite webcomic. _**Ever.**_ _Broodhollow's_ art is beautiful and the story writing is some of the best I've ever read. One part comedy and two parts creeping horror, if the phrase "Tintin meets H.P. Lovecraft" appeals to you at all, [go read it right now](http://broodhollow.chainsawsuit.com/). If author Kris Straub can finish the comic with a _tenth_ of the talent he's exhibited so far, I'm confident this will go down as one of the great graphic novels of our generation.

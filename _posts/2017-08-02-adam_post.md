When a keyboard enthusiast pictures a keyboard case in their mind, it's often one of two things: a standard minimalistic covering or a sleek industrial design. RAMA's M65-a, /u/evangs' MiniVan, the FJELL keyboard case--the gorgeous curves and edges of these keyboard revel in simplicity and modern machining.  I love the look, but I sometimes feel that this aesthetic has a somewhat limited imagination. Just because the technology is modern doesn't mean the *keyboard* has to look modern.

In fact, I think technology has progressed to the point where we can start looking *back* for inspiration. 



The name "ADAM" is fitting: it connects to both the Biblical Adam as the first of its kind, and the Adam brothers who created [the style of architecture which inspired it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_style).

The fact that Adam style incorporates simplified Rococo and Baroque elements works perfectly with the natural constraints of the manufacturing process.  Not only would the intricate detail and complex geometries of *true* Rococo/Baroque be lost in the glazing process, but they could have easily pushed the keyboard over the edge from "ornate" to "gaudy."

The front of the keyboard features a cartouche surrounded by paneling. I actually drew the bolection profile to imitate a real profile used at the Palace of Versailles, but the detail is too fine to make out in the finished product.

The sides of the keyboard are decorated with simplified [festoons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Festoon). Festoons are very characteristic of the Adam style, and keep the sides interesting while not distracting (also, festoons are sometimes called *swag*, which is pretty funny). I might test how adding more detail to festoons looks, but the smoothness is growing on me.

The rear has two holes for the MicroUSB cable and TRRS jack, and sports the classic Greek urn--an object prevalent in the Adam brothers' work. The renders on this page are designed to accommodate /u/wootpatoot's [Let's Split v2 PCB](https://github.com/climbalima/let-s-Split-v2). Somewhat frustratingly, the USB and TRRS connections are not symmetrically aligned on the PCB, meaning that the holes in the back cannot be equally spaced. Hand-wired versions of this case will feature nicely symmetric holes for those interested in wiring it themselves.  I'm currently debating whether the festoons on the back are too distracting--feedback would be appreciated.

# But why porcelain?

## ~~But why male models?~~




* old, heirloom, soul
* organic, wabisabi


After seeing [Adrien Friggeri's new 'Blanck' keyboard](http://medium.com/@friggeri/the-new-blanck-keyboard-c7563c4f9fa) a couple months ago, I was struck by two things:

 1. Wow, I didn't know it was possible to 3D print in porcelain, and
 2. If he had made a Let's Split case, he could have printed the entire thing in ceramic and ditched the (in my opinion) unsightly leather/wood connector.
 
Knowing nothing about 3D modeling, I set out to make a sleek, curved porcelain case--I initially wanted to make a ["squircle"/superellipsoid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squircle) design, but there came a point where I stopped,

I like statistical models. I like webcomics. I like not having to suffer through deciding whether a webcomic is ever going to update regularly again. I began to ask myself, "Can I use statistical modelling to tell me when I should stop hoping a webcomic will keep updating?"

Nothing is more haunting than that oft-repeated phrase: "updates when?" It's not even about the wait, it's about the _uncertainty_--either end or start updating, don't keep me in limbo!  I would love it if I could make a model that could just _tell_ me, "Hey, this comic is entering its death spiral, abandon ship!"  Also, I just like learning new statistical methods.

Although that model is still in the works, I've gotten my hands on a bunch of cool data in the meantime.  This post isn't quite a tutorial; it's more like a demonstration of how you can fun with simple web scraping and niche interests--but I've attached all the code I used, complete with documentation and a flexible design for newbies who want to start collecting their own data.

## Web scraping 101

In order to make a model, you generally need data to train it on.  Most webcomics don't have a downloadable R database of all their updates, so you'll have to get the data yourself.  You can click through potentially thousands of pages, recording the dates manually, or you can use **web scraping** to do it automatically[^1].

If you use Python and want an incredibly easy-to-get-into web scraping tool, check out the Python module, [Beautiful Soup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) (I used `bs4`). In a nutshell, it loads HTML pages and parses the elements into a tree automatically. Extracting, say, all the `img` tags on a page can be as simple as: `soup.find_all('img')`. Beautiful Soup is pretty simple to learn and the [documentation](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) makes it a breeze. Check my source code at the end for the code I used.

## Broodhollow updates: a story of an author's life

"Broodhollow."  The name sounds like a title that a moody fifteen-year-old would come up with, but it is **absolutely** my favorite webcomic. _**Ever.**_ _Broodhollow's_ art is beautiful and the story writing is some of the best I've ever read. One part comedy and two parts creeping horror, if the phrase "Tintin meets H.P. Lovecraft" appeals to you at all, [go read it right now](http://broodhollow.chainsawsuit.com/). If author Kris Straub can finish the comic with a _tenth_ of the talent he's exhibited so far, I'm confident this will go down as one of the great graphic novels of our generation.

## Source Code:

> [`web_scraper_threaded_general.py`]({{ site.url }}/code/web-scraping/web_scraper_threaded_general.py)

My multi-thread web-scraper, written for Python 3.4+, requires Beautiful Soup and Pillow. If you have `pip` you can try: `python3 pip install beautifulsoup4` and `python3 pip install pillow`.  This is my first time ever working with threads in Python--probably overkill, but it was fun to learn about. If you have any comments about what I could do better--any rookie mistakes I made--feel free to leave a comment below.

> [`web_scraper_nonthreaded.py`]({{ site.url }}/code/web-scraping/web_scraper_nonthreaded.py)

My crappier, non-threaded, web-scraper with poor documentation. Also written for Python 3.4+, requires Beautiful Soup and Pillow. This is the earlier, crappier version of my code for a few of the examples, more or less.

### Footnotes

[^1]: I should point out, for pedantry's sake, that webcomics make _especially_ easy targets to web scrape, given their fairly consistent structure and general lack of JavaScript. Web scraping is a bit harder when you want to collect JavaScript-generated content--check out `PhantomJS` and `Selenium` Python libraries for good places to start.

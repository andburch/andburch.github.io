## What I want to do

I want to 3D print a custom keyboard case for a certain type of half-keyboard in porcelain.  

Because this porcelain is going to be 
holding a relatively precise steel plate, I'd like the surfaces holding it to be as flat and as even as possible.  I don't think this will be a problem if the case is laying horizontally like it would on a table--gravity should distribute the glaze relatively evenly over the flat horizontal surfaces that will hold the plate.

## The problem: the 3D printer's bounding box

The dimensions of my model are roughly **150 x 110 x 30 mm** (*x*, *y*, *z*). 

However, the maximum bounding box of the printer is **125 x 125 x 200 mm**.  If orientation is unimportant, my
